This directory contains histograms representing the clr-abundance for each of the 88 transcription factors analyzed in this study. These histograms provide a visual representation of the data distributions.
A Lilliefors normality test was conducted on the distribution of each transcription factor. The results of these tests, including statistical metrics and p-values, are clearly depicted on each corresponding figure.
