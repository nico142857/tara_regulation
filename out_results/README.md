This out_results directory contains output files generated by various scripts that are essential for subsequent studies. The files within this directory are organized to facilitate access and use in further data analysis stages.

## Description of subfolders


### out_fingerprint
It includes a series of detailed plots and visualizations representing centered log-ratio (clr) abundance values for transcription factors (TFs), organized and filtered by specific matrix types such as MX, M0, M1, guidi, salazar, and stress. The PDF files within this folder offer various comparative and statistical analyses:
- Line plots to observe trends in clr abundances of TFs.
- Scatter plots that correlate abundances between different samples, such as those from Tara Oceans and human gut samples.
- Annotations of correlation coefficients and linear regression equations, providing clear statistical interpretation. 

### out_correlation
It contains heatmaps, clustermaps, and networks of correlation between the variables involved in this study: TFs abundance matrices and environmental data collected by Tara.

### out_initial_predictions
It contains initial exploratory results aimed at investigating the capacity of transcription factors (TFs) to sense the environment

### out_xgb_models
contains XGBoost classification models designed to classify various environmental variables using transcription factor (TF) abundances as predictors. The classifications include:
- polar / non polar | on surface samples
- Temperature (Low <=10°C, Mid 10-22°C, High >22°C) | on surface samples
- Province (Fremont et. al. 2022) | on surface samples
- Layer (Surface, DCM, Mesopelagic) | on non polar samples
- Layer2 (Epipelagic, Mesopelagic) | on non polar samples
- NO3 (Low <=7, High > 7) | on epipelagic-non polar samples
- CarbonExport Mean Flux at 150m (Low <=0.7, Mid 0.7-3, High >3) | on epipelagic-non polar samples
- NPP (Low <=275, Mid 275-540, High >540) | on epipelagic-non polar samples
The hyperparameters for the XGBoost models were optimized using a tree-based algorithm from the 'Hyperopt' library. A public-private dataset approach was employed for final validation. Classification reports are included in this folder.
