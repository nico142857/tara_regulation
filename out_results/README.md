This out_results directory contains output files generated by various scripts that are essential for subsequent studies. The files within this directory are organized to facilitate access and use in further data analysis stages.

## Description of subfolders


### 'out_fingerprint'
The out_fingerprint subfolder includes a series of detailed plots and visualizations representing centered log-ratio (clr) abundance values for transcription factors (TFs), organized and filtered by specific matrix types such as MX, M0, M1, guidi, salazar, and stress. The PDF files within this folder offer various comparative and statistical analyses:
- Line plots to observe trends in clr abundances of TFs.
- Scatter plots that correlate abundances between different samples, such as those from Tara Oceans and human gut samples.
- Annotations of correlation coefficients and linear regression equations, providing clear statistical interpretation.
